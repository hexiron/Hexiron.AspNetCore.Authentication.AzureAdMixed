# Getting started with ASP.NET Core 2 and Azure AD/B2C

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/11r3paicwclfblmc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mkeymolen/hexiron-aspnetcore-authentication-azureadmixed/branch/master)  [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hexiron/Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/hexiron/Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed/blob/master/LICENSE)  [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed.svg?maxAge=86400)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed/)

Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed contains an extension on the current Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication library that enables  you to use both AzureAD and Azure AD B2C combined.
With this extension you can accept JWT tokens issued by either an Azure AD or Azure B2C tenant. 

You can also define your own authorize attributes with the name of the scopes in Azure B2C and/or Application permissions in Azure AD. This enables you to do fine grained authorization on API method level!

**Features**  

- Scan the assembly controllers for Authorization attributes and get back a list of custom defined policies

```csharp  
assembly.FindAuthorizationPolicies(policyIdentifier: "mypolicyPrefix_")
```

- Validate Azure AD JWT tokens and validate if it contains the correct scope claim as the specified policy in the authorization attribute.

```csharp  
services.AddAzureAdJwtBearerAuthentication(azureAdSettings, typeof(Startup).Assembly);
```

- Validate Azure AD B2C JWT tokens and validate if it contains the correct scope claim as the specified policy in the authorization attribute

```csharp  
services.AddAzureB2CJwtBearerAuthentication(azureAdB2CSettings, typeof(Startup).Assembly);
```

- Validate both Azure AD and Azure AD B2C JWT tokens and validate if it contains the correct scope claim as the specified policy in the authorization attribute

```csharp  
services.AddAzureAdAndB2CJwtBearerAuthentication(azureAdSettings, azureAdB2CSettings, typeof(Startup).Assembly);
```

- TODO: ASPNET.Core OpenIdConnect + authorization flow with Azure B2C for user login

## How to use ##

### 1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project ###
In Visual Studio 2017.
### 2. Add dependency in csproj manually or using NuGet ###
Install the latest package of Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed:
in csproj add:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Hexiron.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAdMixed" Version="x.x.x" />
```

### 3. Make sure you register the settings in the startup class.
You have multiple possibilities to load the settings in the startup class so they can be used by the IOptions pattern in the connectors.  
- Add the settings in you appsettings.json file (and corresponding environment files)
- Add the settings in the application settings online in your Azure Web app. The latter is recomended for the secrets so you don't need to expose them in source code.

See example below if you store them in appsettingsfile:
```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "AzureAd": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Tenant": "tentantname.onmicrosoft.com",
      "ClientId": "aaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaa",
      "ClientSecret": "avoid this and get if from azure vault or imediately from appsettings in azure webapp"
    },
    "AzureAdB2C": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ClientId": "aaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaa",
      "Tenant": "tentantname.onmicrosoft.com",
      "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "defined_Policy_from_Azure",
      "ResetPasswordPolicyId": "defined_Policy_from_Azure",
      "EditProfilePolicyId": "defined_Policy_from_Azure",
      "RedirectUri": "https://.../signin-oidc",
      "ClientSecret": "avoid this and get if from azure vault or imediately from appsettings in azure webapp"
    }
  }
}
```
Make sure you register the configuration settings in the startup class as the extensions in the library are using the IOptions pattern to get them via dependency injection.
```csharp  
private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
{
	_configuration = configuration;
}
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...
	// register Azure AD Settings to be able to use the IOptions pattern via DI
	services.Configure<AzureAdOptions>(_configuration.GetSection("Authentication:AzureAd"));
	var azureAdSettings = _configuration.Get<AzureAd>();

	// register Azure B2C Settings to be able to use the IOptions pattern via DI
	services.Configure<AzureAdB2COptions>(_configuration.GetSection("Authentication:AzureAdB2C"));
	var azureB2CSettings = _configuration.Get<AzureAdB2C>();
	//...
}
```

### 4. Register the middleware service to enable JWT validation
In the startup.cs class, register the middleware.  
You have multiple possibilities:  
- You only register Azure AD JWT validation
- You only register Azure B2C JWT validation
- You register both Azure AD and Azure B2C JWT validation
  
```csharp  
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)  
{  
	// You can only register for Azure AD
	// services.AddAzureAdJwtBearerAuthentication(azureAd, typeof(Startup).Assembly);
	// You can also only register for Azure B2C
	//services.AddAzureB2CJwtBearerAuthentication(azureB2CSettings, typeof(Startup).Assembly);

	// Register for Azure AD and B2C
	services.AddAzureAdAndB2CJwtBearerAuthentication(azureAdSettings, azureB2CSettings, typeof(Startup).Assembly);
}  
```

### 5. Create your Azure B2C tenant and register you API app
**TODO: How to create tenant**
Once your tenant has been created in Azure:

- Add your tenant id (...onmicrosoft.com) to the settings file 
- Create your API app in your B2C tenant. Add the B2C suffix to your app names if your using your B2C tenant for both Azure AD and Azure AD B2C. This for simplicity later on
- Copy the ApplicationId (=ClientId) to the settingsfiles under the AzureADB2C part
- Create a Sign-up/Sign-in policy and select the attributes you want to ask to fill in by the user (Sign-up attributes) and the attributes you want to send to the API (Application claims)
- Copy the name of this sign-up/sign-in policy and add it to the AzureB2CSettings part (SignUpSignInPolicyId)
- Go to "Published scopes" and create the scopes you need to access your APIs (you will add the same scope name as an Authorization policy attribute on your API methods)  
Example: "read:methods"
- Add an Authorization attribute and register this scope as a policy on your API method

```csharp
[Authorize("read:methods")]
public IActionResult Methods()
{
	return Ok();
}
```

### 6. Register your Azure AD application if you need API to API communication (client credentials flow or machine to machine communication

- Within the same B2C Active directory tenant in Azure, go to all services -> Azure Active directory
- Go to App registrations and create your API app.  For simplicity, take the same name as the name you've chosen in Azure B2C but remove the B2C suffix
- Copy the ApplicationId (=ClientId) to the settingsfiles under the AzureAdSettings part
- Open the manifest and add the scopes as AppRoles:  
Make sure you create unique identifiers as Id

```json
"appRoles": [
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "Application"
      ],
      "displayName": "Read methods",
      "id": "aaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaa",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "description": "Can read methods",
      "value": "read:methods"
    },
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "Application"
      ],
      "displayName": ".....",
      "id": "aaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaa",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "description": ".......",
      "value": "...:..."
    }
]
```

### 7. Register your client apps and give them the permissions to the scopes
TODO How to create tenant

**In Azure AD B2C**
1. Create a new app for your client
2. Go to API Access
3. Add
4. Select your API app
5. Select the scopes you want to give access to

**In Azure Acitive Directory**
1. Create a new app for your client in App registrations
2. Go to Settings
3. Required Permissions
4. Add
5. Select API
6. Fill in the name of your api app without
7. Select the Azure AD app (without the B2C suffix)
8. Select the permissions you want to give access to
9. Don't forget to click on "Grant Permissions"

The scopes will now be added to the JWT token of the client and validated at API side.

### Testing instructions

If you want to test your application using the WebApplicationFactory, make sure you register the "allowanonymousfilter" and register the policies using the extensionmethod "FindAuthorizationPolicies".
If not, you will get an exception saying the policy has not been registered.  

In your TestStartup.cs class:

```csharp  
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	var authorizationPolicies = typeof(Startup).Assembly.FindAuthorizationPolicies("");
    services.AddAuthorization(o =>
    {
    	authorizationPolicies.ForEach(customDefinedPolicy => o.AddPolicy(customDefinedPolicy, policyBuilder => policyBuilder.RequireClaim("Fake")));
    });
}
```
